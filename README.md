GIPHY API used to create a dynamic web page populated with gifs of choice. The assignment was completed by using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML, combined with CSS and images for styling purposes ([Play the GifTastic game!](https://heidijvr.github.io/GifTastic//))

**Project Requirements:**

* To obtain a GIPHY account and obtaining an API Key by creating an app.
* When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
* Under every gif, display its rating - this data is provided by the GIPHY API.
* Add a user input box which adds a topic with fitting giphys, along with buttons on the page.

-----

**Suggested future challenges:**

* Ensure that the app is fully mobile responsive.
* Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
* List additional metadata such as, title and tags, for each gif.
* Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town.
* Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a favorites section.
